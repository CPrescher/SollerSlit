SollerSlit
==========

This is a Python Software package for collecting X-ray diffraction data with a Soller Slit at APS Sector 13 GSECARS. It
is connecting to an XPS controller which then creates a smooth continues motion by the x-, y- and omega stage to create
a perfect circle movement of the soller slit around the focal point where the sample sits.
